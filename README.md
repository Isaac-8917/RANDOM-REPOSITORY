This is a text based game meaning there are no graphics, there will be text appearing on your screen and you have to make choices. My goal is to have dozens of different endings.

Report issues in the issues section obviously

If you want something to be added then just create a pull request and make the changes. DO NOT commit to the main branch EVER. Make sure you provide a description of your change AND a demo link using replit. If either one of these are missing your pull request will automatically be ignored without question. I will merge your pull request if you meet these peramiters and if it is good.
